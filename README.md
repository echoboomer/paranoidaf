`paranoidaf` is a tool for developers who are constantly paranoid about the configuration of their Kubernetes clusters, specifically those that are in production.

Configuring Kubernetes is hard. A lot of the time, we're doing it on our own with no help from anyone else. If it breaks and impacts our products, people get mad about it.

This tool aims to help developers discover opportunities within Kubernetes clusters so they can sleep at night.

## Installation

Download the latest version for your OS and put it within `$PATH`.
